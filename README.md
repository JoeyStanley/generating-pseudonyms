# generating-pseudonyms
A tutorial on how to use the baby names package to automatically generate age-appropriate pseudonyms.

This is the code that accompanies my blog post, [Assigning Pseudonyms in R with the babynames package](http://joeystanley.com/blog/assigning-pseudonyms-in-r). Note that there may be some discrepencies between these files and the text in the blog post because final edits happen in the blog post only.
